## :zap: Proshop eCommerce app

- Proshop is a simple eCommerce app where users can buy items from a list of products and pay with PayPal. This app uses a MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, and Node), application state is managed with Redux. The PayPal API with a sandbox account is used to simulate the processing of payments. This app is from a tutorial demonstrating Redux with React to manage user actions, create, update, and track user orders.

## :books: General Info

- A simple eCommerce app using React for the frontend, Redux for app state management, Express node.js for the backend server, and MongoDB Atlas as the cloud hosted database. This was built to better understand Redux handles state across the application, more practice with conditional rendering in React, and handling payment with Paypal.
